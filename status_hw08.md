Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Kyle Smith

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/kylesmith-1/webdev-assignment9

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

http://events-spa.devcalibur.com/

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

Comments and invitations are not curently working right / visibly implemented.
Events and users, however exist structured as intended.
Password registration works as well. 
You must log in with name/password still though.
Essentially, the layout is a feed will display all the events created by the
current user.
A link on each event in that feed will take you to the details page for that
event, which currently displays all the same data but would ideally have 
comments and invitation data.
You would also ideally see events in your feed which you are invited to.
Also, I could not get the datepicker to work with this.
I think the overall strucutre is there for fleshing out the remaining features,
particularly showing ownership of particular events, and allowing individual
events pages with unique URLs. 

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

Yes I believe it is properly deployed.
